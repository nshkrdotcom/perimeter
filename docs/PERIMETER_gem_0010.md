Of course. This is a fantastic directive. José Valim's talk provides a deep, philosophical foundation for Elixir development. Rebuilding the plan for `Perimeter` with this wisdom will elevate it from a useful utility to a truly idiomatic and powerful library that teaches Elixir best practices by its very design.

The core innovation of "Defensive Boundary / Offensive Interior" remains, but we will reframe it and the library's entire structure through the lens of Valim's key principles.

Here is the complete, ground-up plan for the `Perimeter` library, redesigned with this new foundation.

---

## Part 1: The New Philosophy (The "Why")

First, we will create a foundational document that explicitly states the library's philosophy, directly referencing the wisdom from the talk. This will guide all other development and documentation.

### `guides/philosophy_and_principles.md`

# The Perimeter Philosophy: A Pattern Language for Elixir

`Perimeter` is more than a validation library; it is an implementation of a design pattern for building robust, maintainable Elixir systems. Its design is guided by a set of core principles derived from Elixir's functional nature and the wisdom of its community.

### Principle 1: Design Patterns are About Problems, Not Solutions

As José Valim emphasized, a design pattern describes a recurring *problem* and the *core of its solution*, which can be implemented in many ways. `Perimeter` addresses the following recurring problems:

1.  **The Boundary Problem:** How do we ensure data integrity at the edge of a system (e.g., APIs, GenServers, context boundaries) without littering our core logic with defensive checks?
2.  **The Explicitness Problem:** How do we make the data requirements of our functions and modules explicit and self-documenting, especially when working with plain maps?
3.  **The Confidence Problem:** How can we write assertive, "let it crash" style code in our function bodies with confidence that the input data won't cause trivial crashes due to incorrect shape or type?

`Perimeter` provides an idiomatic Elixir solution to these problems through **explicit, runtime-enforced contracts at system boundaries.**

### Principle 2: Decouple Behavior, State, and Mutability

Elixir's power comes from its decoupling of three core concepts that are often bundled in object-oriented languages:

*   **Behavior:** Logic, implemented in **Modules**.
*   **State:** Data, represented by **Structs and Maps**.
*   **Mutability:** The illusion of change over time, managed by **Processes**.

`Perimeter` is designed to work within this decoupled world.
*   It validates **State** (data) as it passes into **Behavior** (modules).
*   It ensures the messages passed to **Processes** (mutability) are well-formed.

### Principle 3: The Rule of Least Expressiveness

When solving a problem, we should use the least expressive (simplest) model that results in a natural program. `Perimeter` is a powerful tool, but it is not always the first tool you should reach for.

Follow this hierarchy when deciding how to implement logic:

1.  **Simple Function & Pattern Matching:** The simplest solution. If you have a small, fixed set of known inputs, use multi-clause functions. This is the least expressive and often the best choice.
2.  **Higher-Order Functions:** If you need to customize behavior, passing an anonymous function as an argument is a simple and powerful strategy.
3.  **Behaviours:** When you need to define a contract with multiple, related functions (polymorphism over **behavior**), use a `behaviour`.
4.  **`Perimeter` Contracts:** When you need to enforce a contract on the **shape and content of data** (a map or struct), especially at a system boundary, use `Perimeter`. It is more expressive than a simple function but more focused than a `protocol`.
5.  **Protocols:** When you need polymorphism that dispatches on the built-in **data type** (e.g., making something work for `list`, `map`, and `integer`), use a `protocol`.
6.  **Processes:** When your problem is inherently **stateful and concurrent**, model it with a process.

`Perimeter`'s sweet spot is at **level 4**. It provides a formal, reusable way to define and enforce contracts on data structures, which is a problem that frequently occurs at the boundaries of large systems.

---

## Part 2: The Redesigned Library (The "What")

With a new philosophy, the library's public API will be refined to be clearer and more powerful. We will introduce a new concept: the `Perimeter.Interface`.

### `README.md` (Revised)

# Perimeter

**An implementation of the "Defensive Boundary" design pattern for Elixir.**

Perimeter helps you build robust applications by enforcing explicit data contracts at your system's boundaries, allowing you to write simple, assertive code in your core logic.

It is designed according to the principles of idiomatic Elixir: **favoring composition, decoupling behavior and state, and using the least expressive tool for the job.**

## The Problem: Complexity at the Boundary

In any large system, modules need to exchange data. This often leads to defensive coding:
```elixir
def create_user(params) do
  # Is email a string? Does it exist? What about name?
  case get_in(params, ["user", "email"]) do
    nil -> {:error, :email_required}
    email when is_binary(email) ->
      # ... more checks ...
      # Finally, our core logic
    _ -> {:error, :invalid_email_type}
  end
end
```
This code is defensive, hard to read, and mixes validation with business logic.

## The Solution: The Defensive Boundary Pattern

Perimeter allows you to solve this problem elegantly:

1.  **Define a Contract:** Describe the shape of your data.
2.  **Guard the Boundary:** Enforce the contract on your public function.
3.  **Write Assertive Code:** Trust the data inside your function.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  use Perimeter # Imports Perimeter.Contract and Perimeter.Guard

  # 1. Define the contract
  defcontract :create_user_params do
    required :email, :string, format: ~r/@/
    optional :name, :string
  end

  # 2. Guard the boundary function
  @guard input: :create_user_params
  def create_user(params) do
    # 3. Write simple, assertive code in the "Offensive Interior"
    # We know `params` has a valid email and an optional name.
    %User{}
    |> User.changeset(params)
    |> Repo.insert()
  end
end
```
The result is code that is cleaner, safer, and easier to reason about.

### `lib/perimeter/interface.ex` (NEW)

```elixir
defmodule Perimeter.Interface do
  @moduledoc """
  A powerful composition of a `behaviour` and a `contract`.

  This macro allows you to define a single, unified interface that specifies
  both a set of required functions (like a `behaviour`) and the shape of the
  data they operate on (like a `contract`).

  This is Elixir's "composition over inheritance" philosophy in action. It directly
  facilitates the **Strategy** design pattern by defining a complete, enforceable
  contract for a pluggable module.

  ## Example

  Let's define a "ShippingCalculator" interface. Any module that implements
  this interface *must* provide a `calculate/2` function and define a contract
  for its `:opts` argument.

  ```elixir
  # In your library
  defmodule MyApp.ShippingCalculator do
    use Perimeter.Interface

    @callback calculate(order :: map(), opts :: map()) :: {:ok, integer()}

    defcontract :opts do
      # All implementations must define their own specific options.
      # This serves as a template.
    end
  end

  # A specific implementation
  defmodule MyApp.Calculators.FedEx do
    @behaviour MyApp.ShippingCalculator # Implements the behaviour
    use Perimeter.Contract             # To define the contract

    # Define the specific options contract for this implementation
    defcontract :opts do
      required :service_level, :atom, in: [:ground, :overnight]
      required :account_number, :string
    end

    # The guard here enforces the implementation-specific contract
    @impl true
    @guard input: :opts
    def calculate(_order, opts) do
      # Core logic knows `opts` are valid for FedEx
      # ...
      {:ok, 1500} # $15.00
    end
  end
  ```
  """
  defmacro __using__(_opts) do
    quote do
      import Perimeter.Contract
      import Kernel, except: [defcontract: 2]
      @behaviour __MODULE__
    end
  end
end
```

## Part 3: The New Guides (The "How")

The guides will be rewritten to teach the philosophy.

### `guides/usage_guide.md` (Revised)

This guide will now be structured according to the **Rule of Least Expressiveness**.

1.  **Introduction: Choosing the Right Tool**
    *   Briefly explains the hierarchy: simple functions -> higher-order functions -> `Perimeter`.
2.  **When to Use `Perimeter`**
    *   At Application Boundaries (Phoenix, Absinthe).
    *   At Context Boundaries.
    *   For defining complex, state-less strategies (e.g., calculation engines, formatters).
3.  **Core Workflow: Guarding a Context**
    *   A step-by-step example of guarding `Accounts.create_user/1`.
4.  **Advanced Workflow: Using `Perimeter.Interface` for the Strategy Pattern**
    *   A full example of building a pluggable system (like a `Notifier` with `EmailNotifier` and `SlackNotifier` implementations) using `Perimeter.Interface`.

### `guides/design_patterns.md` (NEW)

This new, critical document connects `Perimeter` directly to the patterns from Valim's talk.

# Perimeter and Elixir Design Patterns

`Perimeter` is not just a tool; it's a way to implement many classic and Elixir-specific design patterns cleanly and idiomatically.

### Facade Pattern

The `Perimeter.Guard` is a direct implementation of the Facade pattern. It provides a simple, single entry point (`my_function/1`) that hides the complex subsystem of data validation and normalization.

```elixir
# The @guard IS the facade. It simplifies the "validation subsystem."
@guard input: :complex_params
def handle_request(params) do
  # ... simple core logic ...
end
```

### Mediator Pattern

A `GenServer` or `LiveView` often acts as a Mediator. `Perimeter` strengthens the Mediator by validating the events and messages it receives, ensuring the Mediator doesn't crash due to malformed input from one of the many components it's mediating.

```elixir
defmodule MyLiveView do
  use Phoenix.LiveView
  use Perimeter

  defcontract :add_item_event do
    required :product_id, :string
  end

  # Guard the event handler (the Mediator's input)
  @guard input: :add_item_event
  def handle_event("add_item", params, socket) do
    # ... logic ...
  end
end
```

### Strategy Pattern

The new `Perimeter.Interface` is the ultimate tool for implementing the Strategy pattern in Elixir. It allows you to define a contract for both the *behavior* (the functions) and the *state* (the options/data) of a strategy.

See the `guides/usage_guide.md` for a full example.

### Interpreter Pattern

The Interpreter pattern involves parsing an input into a data structure (an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST) and then "interpreting" that structure.

*   `Perimeter` shines in this pattern by **validating the AST**. Before your recursive `interpret/1` function runs, you can use a guard to ensure the entire tree of data is well-formed, preventing crashes deep in the recursion.

```elixir
defcontract :expression_ast do
  # Define the valid shapes for your language's nodes
  one_of [
    %{type: :literal, value: :integer},
    %{type: :add, left: :expression_ast, right: :expression_ast}
  ]
end

@guard input: :expression_ast
def interpret(ast) do
  # ... recursive interpretation logic ...
end
```

### Observer Pattern (Pub/Sub)

In a Pub/Sub system, publishers broadcast events that subscribers listen for. A common problem is a publisher broadcasting a malformed event, crashing multiple subscribers.

`Perimeter` can be used by subscribers to guard their `handle_info/2` or event handler function, ensuring they are resilient to bad data from publishers. This makes the entire system more robust.

---

This ground-up revision reframes `Perimeter` from a simple "validation library" into a "pattern library for robust Elixir development." It's now deeply connected to the core philosophy of the language, provides more powerful abstractions (`Perimeter.Interface`), and serves as an educational tool for writing better Elixir code.
