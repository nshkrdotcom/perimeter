Of course. This is an excellent idea. The "Defensive Boundary / Offensive Interior" pattern is a powerful, reusable concept. I will structure this as a new library called `Perimeter`.

Here are the key documentation files for the `Perimeter` library, which directly reference and build upon the philosophy outlined in your 20250702 documents.

# Perimeter

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/perimeter.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/perimeter)
[![CI](https://github.com/your-org/perimeter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/perimeter/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**A library for defining and enforcing explicit type contracts at your Elixir application's boundaries.**

Perimeter allows you to embrace Elixir's dynamic nature and metaprogramming power while providing strong, runtime guarantees where they matter most: at the edge of your system.

It is the public implementation of the **"Defensive Boundary / Offensive Interior"** pattern, designed to solve the challenges of type safety in complex, metaprogramming-heavy frameworks.

## Key Features

*   **Declarative Contracts:** Define the "shape" of your data using a simple, powerful `defcontract` DSL.
*   **Boundary Guards:** Enforce contracts at function boundaries with a single `@guard` attribute.
*   **Gradual Enforcement:** Start with logging (`:log`), move to warnings (`:warn`), and finally to strict enforcement (`:strict`), allowing for safe, incremental adoption in existing codebases.
*   **Structured Errors:** Get detailed, structured error information on contract violations.
*   **Anti-Pattern Avoidance:** Encourages best practices and helps eliminate common Elixir anti-patterns.
*   **Performance Conscious:** Designed for minimal overhead with compile-time optimizations and configurable runtime behavior.

## Installation

Add `perimeter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:perimeter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

Let's guard a Phoenix controller action.

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/controllers/user_controller.ex
defmodule MyAppWeb.UserController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller
  use Perimeter # Imports Perimeter.Contract and Perimeter.Guard

  # 1. Define the contract for incoming parameters.
  defcontract :create_user_params do
    required :user, :map do
      required :email, :string, format: ~r/@/
      required :password, :string, min_length: 8
      optional :name, :string
    end
  end

  # 2. Guard the controller action with the contract.
  @guard input: :create_user_params
  def create(conn, params) do
    # 3. Inside the guarded function, you can trust your data.
    # This is the "Offensive Interior". Use assertive access!
    # No more defensive `get_in`, `||`, or `case`.
    user_attrs = params.user

    case Accounts.create_user(user_attrs) do
      {:ok, user} ->
        conn
        |> put_status(:created)
        |> render("show.json", user: user)

      {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{} = changeset} ->
        conn
        |> put_status(:unprocessable_entity)
        |> render("error.json", changeset: changeset)
    end
  end

  # Perimeter will automatically handle invalid requests.
  # If the contract is violated, it will return a structured
  # error, which can be converted to a 422 response by a Plug.
end
```

## The Perimeter Philosophy

Perimeter is built on the **"Defensive Boundary / Offensive Interior"** design pattern. This pattern acknowledges a fundamental truth of large Elixir systems: trying to achieve perfect static type safety everywhere is often at odds with the language's most powerful features (like metaprogramming).

Instead, we focus our efforts on the boundaries.

1.  **The Defensive Perimeter:** This is the entry point to your module or system (e.g., a controller action, a public API of a context, a GenServer's `handle_call`). Here, we use `Perimeter.Guard` to strictly validate all incoming data against an explicit `Perimeter.Contract`.

2.  **The Transition Layer:** Once data is validated, Perimeter can optionally transform it (e.g., converting string keys to atoms, providing default values). This prepares the data for the interior.

3.  **The Offensive Interior:** This is the body of your guarded function. Inside this trusted zone, you are free to use Elixir's full power. You can use assertive pattern matching (`%{key: val}`), metaprogramming, and dynamic features with confidence, knowing that the data's structure has already been guaranteed by the perimeter guard.

This approach provides the best of both worlds: the robustness of a type-safe system and the flexibility of a dynamic one.

*For a comprehensive analysis of the philosophy and formal type relationships that led to this library, please see the [original Jido Framework Type System design documents (20250702)](./docs20250702/).*

## Solving Common Elixir Anti-Patterns

Perimeter is designed to programmatically guide you away from common anti-patterns.

| Anti-Pattern | How Perimeter Solves It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Assertive Map Access** | Contracts guarantee the shape of data, allowing you to use assertive `map.key` and `%{key: val}` access inside guarded functions. |
| **Dynamic Atom Creation** | Contracts can validate incoming strings against an explicit list of allowed values, which can then be safely converted to existing atoms. |
| **Complex `else` Clauses in `with`** | Promotes a single, clear validation step at the beginning of a function, simplifying the "happy path" logic within the `with` block. |
| **Long Parameter Lists** | Encourages grouping related parameters into a map that is validated by a single, clear contract. |
| **Non-Assertive Pattern Matching** | By validating the data shape at the boundary, you can write assertive, non-defensive code in the function interior, letting it crash on unexpected (and now truly exceptional) data shapes. |

### `lib/perimeter.ex`

```elixir
defmodule Perimeter do
  @moduledoc """
  The main entry point for the Perimeter library.

  Provides a `use Perimeter` macro to conveniently import the core
  functionality for defining and guarding contracts.

  ## The Perimeter Philosophy

  Perimeter implements the **"Defensive Boundary / Offensive Interior"**
  design pattern. This pattern advocates for strict, explicit data validation at
  the boundaries of your system, which in turn allows for more flexible,
  assertive, and dynamic code within those boundaries.

  The core workflow is:
  1. **`use Perimeter`** to bring in the necessary tools.
  2. **`defcontract/2`** to define the expected shape of your data.
  3. **`@guard/1`** to enforce that contract on a function boundary.

  By adopting this pattern, you gain runtime type safety where it's most
  critical, without sacrificing the metaprogramming power and flexibility
  that make Elixir productive.

  For a deeper dive into the design philosophy, see the main `README.md` file.

### `lib/perimeter/contract.ex`

```elixir
defmodule Perimeter.Contract do
  @moduledoc """
  A DSL for defining declarative data contracts.

  Contracts are defined at compile time and are used by `Perimeter.Guard`
  to validate data at runtime. They serve as both executable validation
  rules and clear documentation for your module's public interface.

  This module is typically imported via `use Perimeter`.
  """

  @doc """
  Defines a contract.

  A contract is a named set of rules that describe the expected shape, types,
  and constraints of a map.

  ## Examples

      defcontract :create_user_params do
        # Fields can be required or optional
        required :email, :string, format: ~r/@/
        optional :name, :string, max_length: 100

        required :profile, :map do
          required :age, :integer, min: 18
          optional :bio, :string
        end

        # Fields can be lists of a specific type
        optional :tags, {:list, :string}

### `lib/perimeter/guard.ex`

```elixir
defmodule Perimeter.Guard do
  @moduledoc """
  Enforces contracts at function boundaries.

  The `guard/1` macro wraps a function, creating a "Defensive Perimeter"
  around it. It intercepts the function call, validates the arguments
  against the specified contract, and only executes the original function
  if the data is valid.

  This module is typically imported via `use Perimeter`.
  """

  @doc """
  Guards a function with an input and/or output contract.

  ## Options

  * `:input` - (Required) The name of the contract to validate the first argument against.
  * `:output` - (Optional) The name of the contract to validate the function's return value against.
  * `:enforcement` - (Optional) The enforcement level. Can be `:strict` (default), `:warn`, or `:log`.

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp.Actions.CreateUser do
        use Perimeter

        defcontract :input_contract do
          required :email, :string

        # This guard will validate `params` against :input_contract
        # and the return value of the function against :output_contract.
        @guard input: :input_contract, output: :output_contract
        def run(params, _context) do
          # ... logic ...
