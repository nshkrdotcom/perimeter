Of course. Here is a `README.md` for the `Perimeter` library. It is designed to serve as the main entry point for the project, with a focus on the well-documented design and philosophy, linking out to the more detailed documents as requested.

**An implementation of the "Defensive Perimeter / Offensive Interior" design pattern for Elixir.**

Perimeter helps you build robust and maintainable applications by enforcing explicit data contracts at your system's perimeters. This allows you to write simple, assertive, and highly dynamic code in your core logic with confidence.

It is designed according to the principles of idiomatic Elixir: favoring composition, decoupling behavior and state, and using the least expressive tool for the job.

## The Problem: Complexity at the Edges

In any large system, modules need to exchange data. This often leads to defensive coding, which is verbose, error-prone, and mixes validation with business logic:

```elixir
def create_user(params) do
  # Is email a string? Does it exist? What about the name?
  case get_in(params, ["user", "email"]) do
    nil -> {:error, :email_required}
    email when is_binary(email) ->
      # ... more checks ...
      # Finally, our core logic
    _ -> {:error, :invalid_email_type}
  end
end
```

## The Solution: The Perimeter Philosophy

Perimeter allows you to solve this problem elegantly by establishing a **Defensive Perimeter** around a trusted **Offensive Interior**.

1.  **Define a Contract:** Describe the shape of your data using a clear, declarative DSL.
2.  **Guard the Perimeter:** Enforce the contract on your public functions.
3.  **Write Assertive Code:** Trust the data inside your functions and use Elixir's full power.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  use Perimeter # Imports Perimeter.Contract and Perimeter.Guard

  # 1. Define the contract for incoming data
  defcontract :create_user_params do
    required :email, :string, format: ~r/@/
    optional :name, :string
  end

  # 2. Guard the perimeter function
  @guard input: :create_user_params
  def create_user(params) do
    # 3. Write simple, assertive code in the "Offensive Interior"
    # We know `params` has a valid email and an optional name.
    %User{}
    |> User.changeset(params)
    |> Repo.insert()
  end
end
```

This approach provides the best of both worlds: the robustness of a type-safe system where it matters most, and the flexibility and power of a dynamic language in the implementation details.

## Installation

This package is not yet on Hex.pm. Once published, it can be installed by adding `perimeter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:perimeter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Solving Common Elixir Anti-Patterns

Perimeter is designed to programmatically guide you away from common Elixir anti-patterns, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

| Anti-Pattern                      | How Perimeter Solves It                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-Assertive Map Access**      | Contracts guarantee the shape of data, allowing you to use assertive `map.key` and `%{key: val}` access.              |
| **Dynamic Atom Creation**         | Contracts validate incoming strings against an explicit list of allowed values, which can then be safely converted to existing atoms. |
| **Complex `else` Clauses in `with`** | Promotes a single, clear validation step at the beginning of a function, simplifying "happy path" logic.          |
| **Non-Assertive Pattern Matching**  | By validating the data shape at the perimeter, you can write assertive, non-defensive code in the function interior. |
